/*
	In Cart\Db add:
		load_cart
		save_cart
		
		which use serialize and file functions to save the $cart array

		at the bottom of this file, test if the db file exists, if so set $cart to load_cart()

		
	In this exercise, ensure all file names and extensions are given const-defintions,
	eg. 
		const TEMPLATE_EXTENSION = '.phtml';
		
		
		
	Refresh your index.php a few times, you should see your cart getting new items each time!
